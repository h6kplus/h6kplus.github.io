description: 
  Hi, my name is Yidong Huang, and I'm a senior student at University of Michigan, majoring in computer science.
  
interest:
   I specialize in **<u>Embodied Artificial Intelligence</u>** and the development of **<u>Task-Learning Agents</u>** that interact with humans and environments. My focus is on enabling these agents to make autonomous decisions through observation of different modalities. 
outside-work:
  Aside from work, I'm interested in all kinds of sports, playing and developing games, 
  watching animations, and connecting with all kinds of people. If you have any interest in common,
  please contact me via email!

call-for-work:
  I'm actively seeking summer intern for 2024, and I will be applying for Phd at Fall 2025. 
  If you have any opportunity, please feel free to contact me.
