    summary: Admitted to findings of EMNLP 2022
    description: we tackled the limitations of vision-language navigation tasks, where most existing approaches were limited in their ability to navigate in a continuous and dynamic environment and communicate with humans in free-form. To address these limitations and collect data, we extended the traditional Wizard of Oz study and proposed the duo-wizard setup. This allowed us to add dynamic changes in the environment and tasks to the simulation, which provided a more realistic testbed for evaluating an agent's ability to communicate and navigate.
