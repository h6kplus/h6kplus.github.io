    title: DOROTHIE, Spoken Dialogue for Handling Unexpected Situations in Interactive Autonomous Driving Agents
    summary: Admitted to findings of EMNLP 2022
    description: we tackled the limitations of vision-language navigation tasks, where most existing approaches were limited in their ability to navigate in a continuous and dynamic environment and communicate with humans in free-form. To address these limitations and collect data, we extended the traditional Wizard of Oz study and proposed the duo-wizard setup. This allowed us to add dynamic changes in the environment and tasks to the simulation, which provided a more realistic testbed for evaluating an agent's ability to communicate and navigate.

    title: A-ESRGAN, Training Real-World Blind Super-Resolution with Attention U-Net Discriminators
    summary: Admitted to PRICAI 2022
    description: In the field of Computer Vision, my work focuses on a novel approach to Blind Image Super-Resolution (SR), a task aimed at restoring low-resolution images affected by complex, unknown distortions. My key contribution is the development of A-ESRGAN, an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model featuring an attention U-Net based, multi-scale discriminator. This model stands out as the first to integrate attention U-Net structure as a discriminator in GAN for addressing blind SR challenges.
    
      My research addresses the limitations of existing GAN structures that neglect an image's structural features, leading to issues like twisted lines and background anomalies. A-ESRGAN overcomes these through its unique design, enabling enhanced focus on structural details across multiple scales. The result is a breakthrough in generating more perceptually realistic high-resolution images.

      This work not only sets a new benchmark in the non-reference natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) metric but also demonstrates, through extensive ablation studies, how the RRDB-based generator in A-ESRGAN effectively leverages image structural features, outperforming previous models in blind SR tasks.
